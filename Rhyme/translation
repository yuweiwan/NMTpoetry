my sky is here and now
my sky is my idea
of sky
he is friendly
reliability ,
sympathy ,
in the case of gold and accident
my sky isn ’ t full of violent
but full of solidarity ,
my sky is also a utopia
about a fairer world ,
in the insight and indulgence
should be daily reality
heaven is the fixed net
similar thinking and feel more
and happiness
to belong to it
if there ’ s another sky
there should be
i let myself be surprised
